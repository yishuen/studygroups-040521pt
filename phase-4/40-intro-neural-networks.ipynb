    "### Gradient Descent in Neural Networks\n",
    "Neural Nets are usually implemented at scale with large sets of data, therefore optimizing for speed becomes a big concern. Gradient descent can take a very **very** long time to run if we use a single training example every time to update the weights and biases. Therefore, we usually use batch-mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batch**: \n",
    "In batch gradient descent, we pass all of the training examples through the forward propagation stage before using backpropagation to compute the weights and biases\n",

    "An epoch is when you're done passing all training examples through the forward propagation\n",

    "##### Types of Gradient Descent\n",
    "- Stochastic Gradient Descent \n",
    "\n",
    "SGD calculates the error and update the weight after training each observation in the training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Batch Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch calculates the error after each example is trained, but only updates the weight after all of the observations have been trained\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mini-Batch Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Mini-batch is a compromise between batch and SGD - it splits the training examples into mini batches, and calculates the error and update the weight after each iteration of the mini batches are done training. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Initialization \n",
    "When we feed the node values forward through layers, we intialize the weights with random values and biases to be zero. We do not initialize the weights to be 0 because it would cause the training to be pointless because all weights would end up being the same. You also do not want a very large initial weights because that would saturate the value of activation function, causing taking the gradient of the activation function to be hard (only when you use sigmoid and tanh though)."
